# Early-Stage Cardiovascular Disease Detection

Key points:
 - Around 300 medical data of Bangladeshi patients have been collected from Khulna
Medical College, Bangladesh to determine the early-stage detection of CVD.
 - 3 different machine learning algorithms have been selected and among those, Random
Forest algorithm yielded maximum accuracy of 97% using F1 score. Moreover,
maximum AUC of 0.99 has been obtained for this algorithm.
 - While investigating, it has been found that many of the patients suffering from high
blood pressure, high cholesterol, chest pain and shortness of breath and by using
machine leaning algorithms especially these features were given maximum emphasize
to determine the early-stage CVD.
